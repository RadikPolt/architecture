									<p>Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind.
										The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
										They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health
										to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

										If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power
										of thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives,
										including our financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as
										intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?

										We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
										Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking.
										Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on
										it consistently.

										Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
										prosperity into your life:

										Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
										express heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a
										few of these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction
										— on abundance, not lack.

										Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
										statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat
										them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your
										subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.

										Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish
										to achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same
										way affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually
										these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being
										prosperous, and you will become so.

										Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be
										one of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary,
										tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and
										you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If
										you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people
										who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim
										higher.

										Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like.
										Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will
										begin to build up and attract more money.

										Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such
										that we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
										will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

										Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day.
										But over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want.
										Once you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!

									<p>Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of
										recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.

										Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both
										walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed
										as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side
										because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet
										acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to model
										your business after?

										Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it
										or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
										competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of
										your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
										people.

										Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping
										it there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
										Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of
										both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a
										catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you
										are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this
										type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is
										quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their
										appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your
										potential customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will
										be your customers.

										There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target
										market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
										seen by them.

										Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from
										my competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
										yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a
										crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
										saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
										budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap
										during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television
										promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the
										year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or
										heard anything about them for so long.

										Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for
										the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming
										down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are
										becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing
										of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage
										with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to
										pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people
										“in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is
										going to cost you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you
										have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.

											<p>Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are... searching for a
												particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once and
												they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t
												have to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of
												your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out
												there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t
												need to do it again for at least 6 months.

												2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it.
												Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds.
												The only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite
												frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
												concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming in
												the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

												3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product
												or service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can
												tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or
												service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have
												one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they
												can post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the
												advertising for you. All for free.

												4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your
												site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list
												just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a
												few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.

												5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you
												sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look
												for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do
												not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
												reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your area of
												business. Forums are great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
												will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they
												were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

												6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free,
												but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
												posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t
												want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I
												would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy
												browser. There are others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend
												one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.

												7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of
												business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to
												find something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they see
												the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with
												the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping
												group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

												The problem still stands, when it comes time to advertise your business for a cheap
												cost. I know you have looked for this answer everywhere; I am here to share a few
												simple yet creative ways, to advertise your new home business. A few suggestions
												would be, newspapers is the one source that many people go to, when they have just
												opened there business. You would need to research online, for newspapers that are in
												your area. Newspapers are a very simple yet effective tool to use to take your
												business from basic home based business to business galore. Having catchy phrases
												and pictures or photographs of your products should help spice it up. Knowing your
												audience is the key to businesses. There are also, radio stations you could call in,
												or even email too. If you are a communicator, you can try to get onto a radio
												station and just share your business. You would need to write an outline or some
												type of catchy jingle that will help you be different from the rest of the business.
												The creativity comes from within. Knowing your target and knowing what you provide
												is gold, will surely, make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Did you know
												that creativity comes from the heart and soul in once you find the creative voice
												you will find all kinds of ways to advertise your home business without spending a
												fortune for a market rep when you can do it yourself saving yourself time and money
												where you can be spending it on something else.

												You may also want to try in write a catchy jingle that will catch your readers and
												target audience. Being creative with your jingle will sure bring you visitors to
												your business rather it’s a restaurant or corporate business many people have
												jingles like McDonalds, Wendy’s, Subway, and Pizza Hut these people came up with
												there own jingles to sale there products to there target audience. Another thing you
												can do is sit down and write out an outline of the things you’re trying to sale than
												right and catchy but simple jingle that will stop your audience dead in there
												tracks. Many people hire writers for there jingles in some right there jingles
												themselves which will also save you more money that way also without going over your
												budget. You can say something like Dixie Professional Writing Service always on your

											<p>There are many things that are important to catalog design....
												Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the
												text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s product
												pages all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new
												customers and sales.

												However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper
												you will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to
												your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more
												product they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper choices
												you have to print your catalog on.

												First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
												catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.

												Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog.
												Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can
												still display your products well.

												So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will
												my cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

												Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of
												the paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be
												60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only
												chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some
												is measured by thickness or “points”.

												Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you
												can choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more
												expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive product.

												There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be
												printed on. Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.

												If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can
												choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your
												catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is
												absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.

												If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
												quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital
												printing.

												It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of
												paper is available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better
												idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to
												suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best for your catalog.

												Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for you
												to choose from or may be able to order for you.

												Dull Coated Paper

												Matte Coated Paper

												Glossy Coated Paper

												Antique Paper

												Vellum Paper

												Wove Paper

												Smooth Paper

												Felt Paper

												Linen Paper

												Fiber-added Paper

												Laid Paper

												Parchment

												Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and
												ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper.
												It affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how
												much your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your
												text and images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your
												customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also how
												your images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier images while high
												quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.

												Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for
												printing your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know what
												your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.</p>

												business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to
												find something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they see
												the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with
												the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping
												group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

												cost. I know you have looked for this answer everywhere; I am here to share a few
												simple yet creative ways, to advertise your new home business. A few suggestions
												would be, newspapers is the one source that many people go to, when they have just
												opened there business. You would need to research online, for newspapers that are in
												your area. Newspapers are a very simple yet effective tool to use to take your
												business from basic home based business to business galore. Having catchy phrases
												and pictures or photographs of your products should help spice it up. Knowing your
												audience is the key to businesses. There are also, radio stations you could call in,
												or even email too. If you are a communicator, you can try to get onto a radio
												station and just share your business. You would need to write an outline or some
												type of catchy jingle that will help you be different from the rest of the business.
												The creativity comes from within. Knowing your target and knowing what you provide
												is gold, will surely, make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Did you know

												target audience. Being creative with your jingle will sure bring you visitors to
												your business rather it’s a restaurant or corporate business many people have
												jingles like McDonalds, Wendy’s, Subway, and Pizza Hut these people came up with
												there own jingles to sale there products to there target audience. Another thing you
												can do is sit down and write out an outline of the things you’re trying to sale than

												tracks. Many people hire writers for there jingles in some right there jingles
												themselves which will also save you more money that way also without going over your
